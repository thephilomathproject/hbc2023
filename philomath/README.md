Our project records are uploaded through a smart contract to the
Algorand Milkomeda Testnet blockchain.  Data is written to other
blockchains as well through Axelar, offering third parties access to
data where they find it most convenient.  Our backend code was made
using Thirdwebâ€™s developer tools.  All of our code is open-source and
available on the project GitHub page.
